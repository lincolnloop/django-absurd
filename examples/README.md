# django-absurd example

A minimal Django project using **django-absurd** as the
[Django Tasks](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/6.0/topics/tasks/) backend, backed by
Postgres. Fully containerized — `docker compose up` runs the whole thing; no host
Python, uv, or Postgres needed.

It defines `@task` functions in `demo/tasks.py` — sync and `async def` — enqueues them,
and runs the `absurd_worker` to execute them (one worker runs both kinds).

## Layout

```
examples/
  compose.yaml              # db (Postgres) + app (the Django demo); no host ports
  Dockerfile                # app image (built from the repo root so it uses local django-absurd)
  pyproject.toml            # deps: django>=6, django-absurd (local path), psycopg[binary]
  manage.py
  demo_project/settings.py  # INSTALLED_APPS + DATABASES + TASKS(AbsurdBackend) + router
  demo/tasks.py             # @task add / create_user / create_user_async (async ORM)
  demo/management/commands/enqueue_demo.py
```

## Run it

From this `examples/` directory:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

That brings up Postgres, waits for it, then the `app` service runs the full flow and
exits `0`:

1. `manage.py migrate` — creates the auth tables **and** the Absurd schema.
2. `manage.py enqueue_demo` — enqueues `add(2, 3)`, `create_user("alice")`, and the
   async `create_user_async("alice-async")`. The first enqueue **auto-creates** the
   `default` queue — no `absurd_sync_queues` step is needed (it stays available for
   eager provisioning / policy reconciliation).
3. `manage.py absurd_worker --burst` — consumes the `"default"` queue (the default);
   reconciles it on start (reporting to stdout), drains it, runs all three tasks
   (per-task start/completed logs) — sync tasks in a thread pool, the `async def` task
   on the event loop — then exits.

You'll see the worker execute all three tasks in the logs. Clean up with:

```bash
docker compose down -v
```

## Try more

Run one-off commands against the running stack with `docker compose run`:

The image autoloads the virtualenv (it's on `PATH`), so commands are plain
`python manage.py …` — no `uv run` prefix:

```bash
# Enqueue again
docker compose run --rm app python manage.py enqueue_demo

# Run a long-lived blocking worker (Ctrl-C to stop). --concurrency N sizes both the
# event-loop concurrency (async tasks) and the sync thread pool.
docker compose run --rm app python manage.py absurd_worker --concurrency 4

# Validate the TASKS / queue configuration
docker compose run --rm app python manage.py check
```

## Worker modes

- **Burst** (`--burst`): process the available backlog, then exit `0` — what the default
  `compose up` uses (good for cron / one-shot drains).
- **Blocking** (no `--burst`): long-running; polls until `SIGINT`/`SIGTERM`. Supports
  `--concurrency N` (sizes the event loop + the sync thread pool), `--claim-timeout`,
  `--poll-interval`, `--batch-size`, `--worker-id`.

Both modes run sync and `async def` tasks (sync in a thread pool, async on the loop).

## Notes

- Tasks are resolved by import path, so they can live in any importable module —
  `tasks.py` is just a convention. (`demo/tasks.py` here.)
- django-absurd requires the **psycopg (v3)** PostgreSQL backend — Django selects it
  automatically for `django.db.backends.postgresql` when `psycopg` is installed.
- The app connects to Postgres over the compose network (`db:5432`); the demo task
  `create_user` uses `get_or_create` because Absurd delivers at-least-once (handlers
  should be idempotent).
